### Shredder  
Given an example file with the string "Hello world", shredding this file into 2 shreds would result in the following files and contents:  
                                                                                             
Shred 1: "Hlowrd"  
Shred 2: "el ol"  

The more shreds there are, the more obscure each shred will be. The minimum data per shred isone byte.  
Optionally, zip compression may be applied to the data.
